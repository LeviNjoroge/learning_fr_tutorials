    <h1>I love Winter</h1>
    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year. It is the season of the year when the sun is lowest in the sky. The days are shorter and the nights are longer. The weather is cold and dry. The flowers are dormant and the trees are bare. The animals are inactive and the birds are silent. Winter is the time for rest and relaxation. It is the time to enjoy the indoors and the warmth of the fire. Winter is the time to relax and enjoy the snow.</p>
