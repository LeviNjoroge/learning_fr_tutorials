    <h1>I love Summer!</h1>
    <p>Summer is the hottest season of the year. It is the season of the year when the sun is hottest. The days are longer and the nights are shorter. The weather is warm and dry. The flowers are in bloom and the trees are green. The animals are active and the birds are singing. Summer is the time for fun and relaxation. It is the time to enjoy the outdoors and the beauty of nature. Summer is the time to relax and enjoy the sunshine.</p>
